-- A) Linear spline (linear interpolation) --

造 The resultant interpolants are seen in the plot "lin_spline_plot.png"

造 Comparison with GSL's [gsl_interp_linear] and [gsl_interp_eval_integ];
The integral of the interpolant            from x[0] = 0 to z = 11 is         = -0.971902
The integral of cos(x) (from math.h)       from        0 to     11 using GSL  = -0.99999
The integral of cos(x) (from WolframAlpha) from        0 to     11            = -0.99999

-- B) Quadratic spline --

造 The resultant interpolants are seen in the plot "quad_spline_plot.png"

-- C) Cubic spline --

造 The resultant interpolants are seen in the plot "cubic_spline_plot.png"
