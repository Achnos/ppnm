Title:

¤ Adaptive recursive integrator with subdivision into three subintervals.


Description:

¤ Implement a (one-dimensional) adaptive recursive integrator (open or closed quadrature, at your choice) which at each iteration subdivides the interval not into two, but into three sub-intervals. Reuse points. Compare with the adaptive integrator from your homework.

Conclusion:

¤ The tri-division variant uses less recursive calls in general, so performs better all in all.
