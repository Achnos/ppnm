# --- ABOUT MAKEFILES, BASIC SYNTAX, MACRO DEFINITIONS, VARIABLES AND RULES ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# --- 
# make is a utillity to manage project in computer filesystems, where objects are manipulated according to certain rules. A makefile should always have the name 'makefile' otherwise it must,
# if it is called SomethingElse, the make utility is called with 'make -f SomethingElse'.
# When make is run it automatically reads the descriptions in the makefile and updates the project if  necessary. 
# ---
### Macro definitions
# A macro definition looks like a normal assignment in a programming language,
# ---
# CFLAGS = -Wall -lm # This is a macro definition
# ---
# The macro can be called as $(CFLAGS) and will return the string "-Wall -std=gnu99".
# ---
# ---
### Rules
# A rule looks very much like an instruction for preparing a dish. It has the following syntax,
# dish : ingredients
# ⊣ recipe
# or
# target : prerequisites
# 	recipe
# By default make only builds the first target, so one usually defines a PHONEY target to handle  more than one targets, that depends on the targets that must be built by default.
# ---
# .PHONEY: default
# 	default : target1 target2 target3

	./$(PROGRAM) > $(OUTPUTFILE)  		# Generate someoutput.txt and send the terminal output of someprogram into it.
			        	 	# This target basically runs the program and sends it into a .txt file called someoutput.txt


$(PROGRAM) : $(OBJECTS)     	      		# Someprogram depends on someobject.o
	gcc $(OBJECTS) -o $(PROGRAM) $(CFLAGS)  # Now we link the object file, someobject.o to an output program ('-o') called someprogram. 
						# This is how you make someprogram from someobject.o


$(OBJECTS) : $(FILES)          			# someobject.o depends on somefile.c
	gcc -c $(FILES)       		 	# '-c' flag means compile only and do not link. This is how you make the object file someobject.o from somefile.c

clean:                 	      		 	  # This is "clean" target it does not depend on anything
	rm -f $(OUTPUTFILE) $(OBJECTS) $(PROGRAM) # This target functions as expected, it cleans up the directory of program files.
